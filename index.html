<li>Customer Reviews: Check online reviews and testimonials to gauge the quality of service provided by the contractor. Satisfied customers are often a good indicator of reliability.</li>
<li>Free Estimates: A reputable roofing company should offer free estimates. This allows you to understand the potential costs involved without any obligation.</li>
<li>Warranty: Inquire about warranties on both materials and workmanship. A good warranty reflects the company’s confidence in their services.</li>
